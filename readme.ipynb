    "# Multinational Retail Data Centralization Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to centralize and clean data from a multinational retail company, enabling efficient analysis and business decision-making. The data, initially scattered across various sources, is consolidated into a centralized database, serving as a single source of truth for sales data. The project involves an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, including data cleaning, database schema development, and SQL querying to obtain up-to-date business metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 1: Set up the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Used GitHub to track changes to my code and saved them online in a GitHub repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 2: Extracted and cleaned up data from the data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up a local database named `sales_data` to store data.\n",
    "- Created three Python scripts for data_extraction.py, data_cleaning.py, database_utils.py, each with its own class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Extraction: Implemented methods in the data extraction class to pull data from various sources like CSV files, an API, and an S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User Data Handling: Developed functions in the `DataExtractor` and `DatabaseConnector` classes to clean and extract user data, handle credentials, and access an AWS RDS database. Performed thorough cleaning of user data in the `DataCleaning` class, addressing issues like NULL values, date errors, and incorrect data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Card Details: Used `DataExtractor` to fetch card details from an AWS S3 bucket stored in a PDF, cleaned the data, and uploaded it to the `sales_data` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store Data: Retrieved store data through an API, cleaned it, and uploaded the dataframe to the `sales_data` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Information: Downloaded and extracted information about products stored in a CSV format on AWS S3 using `DataExtractor`, cleaned the dataframe, and uploaded it to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Orders Data: Extracted and cleaned the orders table from an AWS RDS database, uploading the dataframe to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- JSON File Extraction: Extracted data from a JSON file on S3 containing sale details, cleaned it, and uploaded the data to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 3: Create the database schema\n",
    "\n",
    "In this milestone, the focus was on ensuring the accuracy of tables within the `sales_database`â€”confirming correct columns and appropriate data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Column Alignment:**\n",
    "   Ensured that all tables within `sales_database` had the correct columns, and data types were accurately cast.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Keys Addition:**\n",
    "   Added primary keys to all dimension tables. Tables prefixed with \"dim\" were equipped with primary keys to establish unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foreign Key Integration:**\n",
    "   Established foreign keys in the `orders_table` that referenced the primary keys in the other tables. This interlinking created a cohesive relationship within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQL Implementation:**\n",
    "   Utilized SQL to create the necessary foreign key constraints, solidifying the star-based database schema. This enhancement ensures data integrity and enables efficient querying for analytical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 4: Querying the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrote SQL queries to answer following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "task_1.sql : How many stores does the business have and in which countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "task_2.sql : Which locations currently have the most stores?\n",
    "\n",
    "task_3.sql : Which months produce the most sales typically?\n",
    "\n",
    "task_4.sql : How many sales are coming from online?\n",
    "\n",
    "task_5.sql : What percentage of sales come through each type of store?\n",
    "\n",
    "task_6.sql : Which month in each year produced the most sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "task_7.sql : What is our staff headcount?\n",
    "\n",
    "task_8.sql : Which German store type is selling the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "task_9.sql : How quickly is the company making sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
